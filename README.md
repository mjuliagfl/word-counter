# Word Counter

This project's aim is to provide a word counter to a text box. You can use it by typing or pasting some text on the text box, and when clicking the "submit" button, you should be able to see how many words exists on the text.

I've architectured this simple project using react and typescript, I used hooks to manage the form behavior, implemented the counter logic on a separate class, and implemented some tests to the application.

Please note that I'm currently a backend engineer, so frontend in general is not my expertise, but I've tried to build the project the best way I could.

## Requirements
To be able to run this project, you must have `yarn` installed.

## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready to be deployed!


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
